# Self-Watering-Plant-IoT
IoT project demonstrating automatic watering plant

## Introduction and need for project
It often happens that weâ€™ve forgotten to water the plants and it has dried or even died. Often this happens due to our schedule in spite of the fact that we are really interested in growing plants. Also when we are far from home for vacation it is difficult to judge the status of the soil and water it if required.

To cater to these needs we will create an automated plant watering system that will use ESP8266 and a capacitive soil moisture sensor with a water pump so we can automatically measure the soil moisture content and water it when the soil becomes dry. The pump will also automatically turn off when the soil is no longer dry.

## Features of the project

The project will include:
* Real time monitoring of moisture of the soil
* Automatic turning on and off of water pump when moisture level is below and above a particular threshold respectively
* Real time display of soil moisture value and watering state on IoT dashboard
* Bonus : Manually toggle water pump, LCD Screen, Threshold controller, Data Analytics
